Ralph recovery notes

This folder stores a backup copy of setup-ralph.sh.

If you lose the local setup script, you can restore it:
1) Copy setup-ralph.sh to iCloud Drive:
   ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ralph/setup-ralph.sh
2) Run:
   bash "$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ralph/setup-ralph.sh"
3) Reload shell:
   source ~/.zshrc

The setup script will link ~/bin/ralph and ~/.ralph/state to iCloud Drive.
